# Chartly 2.0  Dependabot Configuration
# Purpose:
# - Keep Go + Web + Actions + Docker dependencies patched with a predictable cadence.
# - Group related updates to reduce PR noise and preserve review bandwidth.
#
# Notes:
# - Docker updates are directory-scoped. We explicitly list root + each service directory
#   because Dependabot does not support a recursive wildcard for Docker ecosystems.
