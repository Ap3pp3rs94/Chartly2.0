{{/*
This chart intentionally does NOT create any Kubernetes Secret objects by default.

Use one of the following patterns instead:
  1) Provide Secrets via an overlay (Kustomize/Helmfile) and reference them from Deployments.
  2) Use an external secret manager (e.g., External Secrets Operator) and reference generated Secrets.
  3) If you must, create a Secret manually in the target namespace.

This file must render nothing by default to preserve the "no secrets" guarantee.
