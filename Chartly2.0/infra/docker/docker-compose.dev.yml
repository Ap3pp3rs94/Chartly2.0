    # IMPORTANT (honest behavior):
    # - If "build.context" does NOT exist on disk, Docker Compose will FAIL when building.
    # - If you want to run from a prebuilt image, set CHARTLY_GATEWAY_IMAGE to a valid image name/tag
    #   and ensure the build context path exists (or use a compose variant that omits "build").
